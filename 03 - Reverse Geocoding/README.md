# 03 - Reverse Geocoding


##Reverse Geocoding

Reverse geocoding is the fancy name given to taking lat/lng coordinates and turning them into something a user (or ourselves) will find more useful, like an address.

Being a common thing to need to do when dealing with locations, Apple provides a `CLGeocoder` object which can do this for us. All we need to do is provide this object with a location to turn into an address. We do this in the form of a `CLLocation`. In its simplest form, this is just an object that holds lat/lng values together. To create one, we could do this:

```swift
let location = CLLocation(latitude: 37.33233141, longitude: -122.0312186)
```

With we can now ask the `CLGeocoder` class to take our `location` constant and turn it into an address for us. First lets create a `CLGeocoder` object to work with:

```swift
let geocoder = CLGeocoder()
```

We can then call a method on it, and pass in the location we want geocoded as an argument. The method we want to call is this:

```swift
func reverseGeocodeLocation(_ location: CLLocation, completionHandler: CoreLocation.CLGeocodeCompletionHandler)
```

It has a completion handler, formally known as a "closure" in Swift. In other languages it make be refereed to as a "callback". A closure is just a code block (like any other function) that gets performed after something happens. In this case the completion handler is performed once the server has responded with the information regarding our request. Hopefully the information containing an address, but if not, an error. The final method call for us will look like this: 

```swift
geocoder.reverseGeocodeLocation(location) { (placemarks, error) in
	//Do whatever we need to do with either our placemarks or error...
})
```

More often than not, you'll probably want to check that the completion handler didn't return with an error and also has at least a place mark to work with. So a common use of this method might look something like this:

```swift
geocoder.reverseGeocodeLocation(location) { (placemarks, error) in

  guard let placemark = placemarks?.last else { return }

  print(placemark)

}
```

####One Geocode Request At A Time

Whenever perform the method to geocode, this is processed on a server provided by the good folks over at Apple. It's free to do and we can do it as often as we need...within reason. Ideally we should only be sending one geocode at a time. This is to ensure that the server can get back to us quickly, and that we're not performing unnecessary requests constantly. Conveniently, our `CLGeocoder` has a boolean (true/false) property on it called `geocoding`. So we can find out if we're currently processing a request by doing something simple like this:

```swift
if !geocoder.geocoding {
	//Not currently geocoding (note the not operator (!) at the start of the condition)...
}
```

####Cancel A Geocode

Most of the time the response from a geocode is incredibly fast as it a small amount of data that needs sent and received. But sometimes we may need to manually stop an active geocode request. This is easy to do as well:

```swift 
geocoder.cancelGeocode()
```


```swift 

func randomCoord(firstNum: CLLocationDegrees, secondNum: CLLocationDegrees) -> CLLocationDegrees{
    return CLLocationDegrees(arc4random()) / CLLocationDegrees(UINT32_MAX) * abs(firstNum - secondNum) + min(firstNum, secondNum)
}
```
