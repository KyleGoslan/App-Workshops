## App Workshops

I've put together this repo as a resource for you to be able to review what we've discussed in the workshops. The documentation here is in no way designed to replace the workshops, and you may struggle to understand the notes alone without attending the workshops.

####Why GitHub?
I've chosen to do it in the format for several reasons:
+ It gets you on github.
+ It makes it easy to correct issues (time is limited, so I tend write these fast).
+ Syntax highlighting on code snippets.  
+ Easier for you to copy/paste...even though you would never do that ;). 
+ I'm hoping that you guys can fork, contribute and send me pull requests to the documentation.  
+ You can create issues to ask questions. That way everyone can see them.  

####Questions/Errors
When you're looking at the repo, on the right hand side you'll see "Issues". I want to encourage you to use this as a way to ask questions and notify me of typos or errors. When you enter the issues page you can create a new issue in the upper right. This is essentially just like posting a comment. One thing that would be helpful is that you apply a relevant label. This is done on the right, eg "Question" or "Bug".

####Sample Files & Projects
Where applicable, I'll post files and projects. However, I'll try to refrain from posting full projects unless I feel it's essential. I'll always lean towards posting "completed" examples of files we were working on in the workshops. These will always be in an "Examples" directory for the relevant workshop.
